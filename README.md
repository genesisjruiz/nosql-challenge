# Module 12: NoSQL Databases - nosql-challenge

For this module’s Challenge, I imported a JSON file containing food establishment ratings data into a MongoDB database. Using Python and the PyMongo library, I interfaced with MongoDB to work with non-relational documents. I applied aggregation pipelines to retrieve and analyze data, utilizing Pandas for data manipulation. This enabled me to provide insightful analysis for a food magazine, aiding in their decision-making for future articles.

•	Deliverable 1: A Jupyter notebook containing code that imports the data and sets up and updates the uk_food database.

•	Deliverable 2: A Jupyter notebook containing code that performs the exploratory analysis queries in the database.
